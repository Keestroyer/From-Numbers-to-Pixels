# ðŸŽ® From Numbers to Pixels: A Mathematical Approach to Game Design

This project demonstrates how mathematical concepts can be transformed into simple interactive games or visual simulations using Python and Streamlit.

It was built to bridge mathematical theory with real-world application through game development logic.
